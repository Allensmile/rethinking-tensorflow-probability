# Statistical Rethinking (2nd Edition) with Tensorflow Probability

This repository provides jupyter notebooks that translate various R code fragments found in the
chapters of [Statistical Rethinking 2nd Edition](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Professor Richard McElreath.

Note - These notebooks are based on 8th December 2019 draft. I will update the notebooks once the book is released.

You can browse the notebooks converted into html document by going to this url - [https://ksachdeva.github.io/rethinking-tensorflow-probability/](https://ksachdeva.github.io/rethinking-tensorflow-probability/)
