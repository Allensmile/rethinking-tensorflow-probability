# Statistical Rethinking (2nd Edition) with Tensorflow Probability

This repository provides jupyter notebooks that translate various R code fragments found in the
chapters of [Statistical Rethinking 2nd Edition](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Professor Richard McElreath.

Note - These notebooks are based on 8th December 2019 draft. I will update the notebooks once the book is released.
