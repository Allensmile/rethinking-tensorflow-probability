# Statistical Rethinking (2nd Edition) with Tensorflow Probability

This repository provides jupyter notebooks that port various R code fragments found in the
chapters of [Statistical Rethinking 2nd Edition](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Professor Richard McElreath to python using tensorflow probability framework.

Note - These notebooks are based on the 8th December 2019 draft. I will update the notebooks once the book is released.

You can browse the notebooks converted into html document by going to this url - [https://ksachdeva.github.io/rethinking-tensorflow-probability/](https://ksachdeva.github.io/rethinking-tensorflow-probability/)

## Acknowledgements

My immense gratitude goes to Professor Richard McElreath for writing such a wonderful book. His method of teaching has made somewhat difficult subject of Bayesian Statistics approachable, interesting and to some extent fun as well. We need more educators like you Sir !.

Another person I want to thank is Du Phan (https://github.com/fehiepsi). He is the main author of [Numpyro](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro), a great framework to do Bayesian Analysis. He has ported Statsical Rethinking (2nd Ed) to Numpyro and his notebooks were not only insipirational but were also of great help to me in creating graphs. I borrowed most of his code fragments when it came to plotting the figures using matplotlib.
